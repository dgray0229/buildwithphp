# Build a Website with PHP
This is a basic website using modern MVC frameworks.

In this project I learned how to use composer to easily install and manage packages with composer. Use the Slim Framework to manage my view controller, Twig to create and manage templates, and how to use both together with the help of middleware frameworks. I also used Swift Mailer to manage my form and control input and output.

I created this website with the help of Team Treehouse as a simple tutorial, the difficulty came in that I was using Slim v3 whereas the tutorial was using v2. There were many packages that simply would not work because of the version difference, so I had to develop some workarounds to make sure that the site still worked correctly.

This also doubles as a project for my Free Code Camp certification to *Build a Tribute Page*.
